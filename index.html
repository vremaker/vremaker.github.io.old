        <h1>It's nice to meet you!</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Valerie Remaker and I am a Senior at The University of Washington pursuing a double major in Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) and Psychology. 
          I intend to use these degrees to go into the field of User Experience Design. My goal is to create clean, fun, and intuitive designs through the implementation of both 
          human centered design and psychological principles. I also hope to implement positive psychology in my designs to make the experience online healthier and less addictive. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at The University of Washington, I have been involved in a wide variety of undergraduate research projects in both Psychology and HCDE. In the department of 
          HCDE, I helped run user centered design charrettes for K-12 students to introduce them to the human centered design process; and assisted in qualitative analysis of the impact 
          that these charrettes have on the college students that facilitate them. I also participated in qualitative research which analyzed TikTok videos from the Texas Energy Crisis to 
          understand the role of social media in crisis responses. In the department of psychology, I helped collect data for a Virtual Reality study which investigated participants' 
          reaction to different levels of immersion into simulated natural environments. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also work as an Engineering Ambassador for the College of Engineering to help prospective students get excited about our engineering program, and am involved in Phi Sigma Rho, 
          my engineering sorority. When I am not studying, I love to crochet, swing dance, and enjoy the natural world.
