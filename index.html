            <h2> It's Nice to Meet You! </h2>
            <p> 
              My name is Valerie Remaker and I am a Senior at The University of Washington pursuing a double major in Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) and Psychology. I intend to use these degrees to go into the field of User Experience Design. My goal is to create clean, fun, and intuitive designs through the implementation of both human centered design and psychological principles. I also hope to implement positive psychology in my designs to make the experience online healthier and less addictive. 
<br /> <br />
During my time at The University of Washington, I have been involved in a wide variety of undergraduate research projects in both Psychology and HCDE. In the department of HCDE, I helped run user centered design charrettes for K-12 students to introduce them to the human centered design process; and assisted in qualitative analysis of the impact that these charrettes have on the college students that facilitate them. I also participated in qualitative research which analyzed TikTok videos from the Texas Energy Crisis to understand the role of social media in crisis responses. In the department of psychology, I helped collect data for a Virtual Reality study which investigated participants' reaction to different levels of immersion into simulated natural environments. 
<br /> <br />
I also work as an Engineering Ambassador for the College of Engineering to help prospective students get excited about our engineering program, and am involved in Phi Sigma Rho, my engineering sorority. When I am not studying, I love to crochet, swing dance, and enjoy the natural world.

            <h2>Crochet Buddy </h2>
            <p> <span id="cow">
                In the Spring of 2020, around the start of the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic that caused
                countries to shut down, I took up the art of crochet to fill the days in isolation. Due to my
                inability to count my stitches correctly in each of the rows I completed, the first blanket I
                made came out as more of a trapezoid than a rectangle. The other big issue that most novice
                crochet hobbyists is keeping a consistent tension in the amount that you pull on the yarn to
                create each stitch. Crochet Buddy is an Internet of Things (IoT) device created to assist novice
                crochet hobbyists in their pursuit of beautiful yarn-craft.
