Due to my inability to count my stitches correctly in each of the rows I completed, the first blanket I made came out as more of a trapezoid than a rectangle. The other big issue that most novice crochet hobbyists is keeping a consistent tension in the amount that you pull on the yarn to create each stitch. Crochet Buddy is an Internet of Things (IoT) device created to assist novice crochet hobbyists in their pursuit of beautiful yarn-craft.",

This redesign started with user research, to understand the audience of Seattle Public Transit in order to design for the actual audience. Next, came the creation of six tasks that a user on Seattle Public Transit would complete. Three of these tasks would be designed for a mobile platform, and three of these tasks would be made for a kiosk interaction which would be located at a transit stop. Next, there were diagrams of user flows, to understand how the user would interact with the system while completing their tasks. Then, we created low fidelity wireframes to understand and test the layout of these interactions. Then, we created mood boards and picked a typographic hierarchy and a color scheme. Finally, we created high fidelity wireframes which showcased the fully designed interactions.",
